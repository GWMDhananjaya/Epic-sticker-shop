<h2>ðŸ’¡ Project History</h2>
<p>Originally, this project was intended to be built with the <strong>MERN</strong> stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), but due to the high cost of hosting, I pivoted to using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vite</strong> for a more cost-effective solution.</p>
